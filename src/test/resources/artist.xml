    <bName>BROTHER ALI</bName>
    <bCountry>US</bCountry>
    <bDesc>Hip hop is not about skin colour. Brother Ali is great evidence of this. The albino rapper with the fiery flow is one of the strongest acts from the alternative hip hop scene. 
His reflective hip hop takes lyrical snapshots of social issues such as crime and homelessness - the latter, especially, is a topic that he is highly aware of as he has lived on the street himself. 
The dense flow of themes and issues never leaves the listener with a heavy mind. The wonderfully soulful and pimped music makes sure of that. 
Brother Ali delivers hip hop with both social indignation, clever rhymes and festive beats.</bDesc>
